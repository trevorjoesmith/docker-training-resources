# Introduction to Docker

Welcome to Docker Training Resources! Whether you're just getting started with containers or looking to master advanced Docker workflows, this comprehensive guide has everything you need.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers allow you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.

## Why Learn Docker?

- **Consistency**: Run your application the same way everywhere
- **Efficiency**: Lightweight compared to virtual machines
- **Portability**: Build once, run anywhere
- **Scalability**: Easy to scale applications up or down
- **DevOps Ready**: Perfect for CI/CD pipelines
